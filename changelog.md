## GeckoLib v5.4-alpha-1

## Notes:
No changelog for this version - I'm still in the middle of fixing things up from 1.21.9
I have an entire wiki to do for this thing and a changelog for this one would be a waste of time at this stage.

# NOTE
This version is an ALPHA.
I am fully aware that animations are not working correctly just yet, and there might be some other issues.
This version represents a complete rewrite of AnimationProcessor and AnimationController, and I'm still ironing out issues.

Please let me done with rewriting things, Mojang :)
