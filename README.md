Geckolib is an entity animation loader for Java Edition, which lets you export bedrock animations and play them automatically.

## Installation
[![curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/geckolib.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=1.15)

We use jitpack for publishing as it provides easy access to releases and allows for javadocs in the jars (unlike curseforge).

Please see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki/Getting-Started#getting-started) for detailed installation instructions per modding framework.

## Documentation
GeckoLib provides detailed documentation in the form of a [Wiki](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki) and [Javadocs](http://geckolib.bernie.software/javadocs/). GeckoLib is currently available for Forge 1.12 and 1.15 and Fabric 1.15 and 1.16.
